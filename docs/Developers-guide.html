(0)++++++++ DOWNLOADING LATEST BUILD +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
______________________________________________________________________

Pragyan CMS latest build source code can be downloaded from the SVN 
repository using the following svn checkout command :

>svn co SVN-PATH pragyan

where replace SVN-PATH with anyone of the following :

	For only source-code and default templates :
https://pragyan.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pragyan/trunk/codebase/

	For only Pragyan CMS templates repository :
https://pragyan.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pragyan/trunk/templates/

	For both source-code and all the templates (incl. default) :
https://pragyan.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pragyan/trunk/

The above command will create a folder with the name 'pragyan' in 
the current directory and download the latest sourcecode in there.

You can also use Eclipse Subversion if you don't have SVN installed.
______________________________________________________________________

(1)++++++++ INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
______________________________________________________________________

For those who have downloaded a nightly build of Pragyan CMS v3, and
doing a fresh reinstall please follow the following steps before you
install the CMS (Note that this is NOT for the users who have 
downloaded an official release from Pragyan CMS Sourceforge.net
home page, those users can directly refer to INSTALL/INSTALL.txt)  :

1) Delete all the contents of the cms/config.inc.php file
2) Delete the .htaccess file in the root directory of Pragyan CMS
3) Rename the htaccess-dist file to .htaccess in the root directory 
(If you're using Windows, use Notepad++ to save the file as .htaccess)
4) Follow the instructions in the INSTALL/install.txt file.


______________________________________________________________________

(2)++++++++ REINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
______________________________________________________________________

To safely uninstall Pragyan CMS so that you can reinstall from the 
same files, do the following :

1) If you're in Linux-based operating system, go to the root directory
of Pragyan CMS and execute the following script like this :
>sh scripts/uninstall.sh
Next, delete the old database and create a new one.
2) If you're NOT in a Linux-based operating system, simply follow the 
steps mentioned in INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS.


______________________________________________________________________

(3)++++++++ CODING GUIDELINES ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
______________________________________________________________________
	
	Please follow the following rules strictly while coding for 
	Pragyan CMS
	______________________________________________________________
	
	::::::::::::::::::::::::: SECURITY :::::::::::::::::::::::::::
	______________________________________________________________
	
	
	* Dangerous Variables = $_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST
	
	* Protection Function = escape(), safe_html() 
	(definitions are available in common.lib.php)

	===== RULE 1 =====
	
	Use the escape() function for every dangerous variable
	in any assignment operation i.e. when a PHP variable is being 
	assigned a value of a dangerous variable using '=' operator. 
	Something like $var=$_GET['hi'] should be made to 
	$var=escape($_GET['hi']). This check is to prevent attacks
	of type SQL Injection. 
	
	===== RULE 2 =====
	
	Be careful not to escape the same variable TWICE.

	===== RULE 3 =====
	
	Don't use escape() function when a dangerous variable 
	is used in a conditional operation i.e in a IF, FOR, WHILE or
	'?:' condition statement.

	===== RULE 4 =====
	
	In a MySQL query, put the table name and column names
	within ` ` escape quotes. e.g. "SELECT apple FROM tree WHERE 
	apple=2" should be 
	"SELECT `apple` FROM `tree` WHERE `apple`=2"

	===== RULE 5 =====
	
	Use the safe_html() function whenever a dangerous variable 
	is directly or indirectly being echoed or printed onto the 
	screen. This is to prevent XSS attack. e.g. echo $_GET['hi'];
	should be echo safe_html($_GET['hi']);

	Warning: safe_html() will remove ALL the HTML tags if any in
	the input code. If you deliberately inserted some HTML tags
	then insert it after you filter the code through safe_html().
	
	===== EXAMPLES ===== 

	Vulnerable Code : 
	-----------------

	if(isset($_GET['hello']))
		$var = $_GET['hello'];
	$apple = $_POST['bye'];
	echo $var.$apple.$_GET['me'];
	$safe = $_REQUEST['me'];
	$query = "SELECT * FROM $var WHERE column = $safe 
	AND ".$_GET['wow']." = '{$_POST['next']}'";
	
	mysql_query($query);
	echo $query;


	Secure Code :
	------------- 

	if(isset($_GET['hello']))
		$var = escape($_GET['hello']);
	$apple = escape($_POST['bye']); 
	echo safe_html($var.$apple.$_GET['me']);
	$safe = escape($_REQUEST['me']);
	$query = "SELECT * FROM `$var` WHERE `column` = $safe AND `".
	escape($_GET['wow'])."` = '".escape($_POST['next'])."'";
	mysql_query($query);
	echo safe_html($query);
	
	
	______________________________________________________________
	
	::::::::::::::::::::::: PORTABILITY ::::::::::::::::::::::::::
	______________________________________________________________
	
	===== RULE 1 =====
	
	When creating Templates, don't use the PHP echo short form,
	use the entire echo statement. For example - <?=$HELLO?>
	should be converted to <? echo $HELLO; ?>
	
	===== RULE 2 =====
	
	Avoid using the OS-specific commands in functions like exec().
	In case its impossible to avoid it, try to find an alternative
	for Windows and/or Linux-bases OS also and implement it.
	
	===== RULE 3 =====
	
	Never include JQUERY javascript libraries from within the cms.
	Always include it in the template file if you can, or leave it
	on the assumption that jQuery is already included in the 
	template. If you include it from here, and it also already
	included in the template file, then both will conflict.
	______________________________________________________________
	
	::::::::::::::::::::::: DOCUMENTATION ::::::::::::::::::::::::
	______________________________________________________________
	
 	When writing code, make sure the documentation (comments, so 
 	to speak) follows the guidelines given below. This helps in 
 	generating documentation using tools like Doxygen. Note the
 	slashes, the stars, the dots and anything else typed here.
 

	===== RULE 1 =====
	
	GENERAL COMMENTS:
	
	Start comments using /** rather than /*, or if you prefer the
	C style single line comments, use three slashes in atleast two
	consecutive lines as in
	///
	///
	instead of 
	//
	
	If you use only a single /// line, then that qualifies as a
	brief description. Use it ONLY when you are sure your comment
	can be fit in one line. Otherwise, use multiple /// lines.
 
 	Comments, in general, must look like either
 	
	/**
  	 * Comment goes here
  	 */

	OR

  	///Comment goes here (this qualifies as a brief description)
  	
  	OR
  	
  	///Comment goes here (this qualifies as a detailed
  	///description, because it has 2 or more lines)	
  	
  	===== RULE 2 =====

 	VARIABLES or STATEMENTS:

 	/**
	 * A brief description here. (Note the period (full stop))
	 * More detailed description goes here.
	 */
 	$xyz = hello("world");
 	
 	Note that the documentation is BEFORE the statement.

	===== RULE 3 =====
	
	When it comes to variables or data members of a class,struct,
	union,file or enum, you can also put documentation after the
	declaration. Do:

 	private $myPrivateMember; ///< Description goes here (note 
 	/// the less than symbol)

	===== RULE 4 =====
	
 	FUNCTIONS:

	/**
	 * A description of the function goes here. Give a 
	 * description of each of the arguments that the function 
	 * requires after this, followed by an indication of what the 
	 * return values represent, as shown below:
	 * @param $param1 $param1 is the first parameter, and a
	 * description of the parameter goes here.
	 * @param $param2 The second parameter, and so on for as many 
	 * parameters as the function takes
	 * @return Describe what the function returns here
	 */
	function functionName($param1, $param2) {

	}

	===== RULE 5 =====
	
	NEW FILE :
	
	If you create a new file, make sure the following comment is
	on top of it :
	
	/**
	 * @package pragyan
	 * @file filename.php
	 * @brief Brief description of the file comes here.
	 * Detailed description here is optional.
	 * @author Abhishek Shrivastava <i.abhi27[at]gmail.com>
	 * @copyright (c) 2010 Pragyan Team
	 * @license http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ GNU Public License
	 * For more details, see README
	 */
	 
	 
	===== RULE 6 =====
	 
	CLASS :
	 
	/**
	 * @class myclass
	 * @brief This is the description of the class myclass.
	 * Here goes the detailed description, which is optional.
	 */
	class myclass
	{
	 ...
	}

	===== RULE 7 =====
	 
	BUGS or WARNINGS:
	 
	If there are any bugs in your code, or any warning which you
	may want the person who is going to change your code, to 
	know, or if you want to ask that person to refer to some 
	other fileyou can use the following tags within the comment 
	block:
	 
	/**
	 * ... Here are the usual stuff, description, author, etc
	 * @bug This is a bug in the code
	 * @bug This is another bug
	 * @warning This is a warning
	 * @warning This is another warning
	 */
	 
	===== RULE 8 =====
	
	USAGE:
	
	If you are documenting a function or a class and you want to
	also tell the user how to use that function or how to create
	an object of that class, you can use a similar comment :
	
	/**
	 * Here goes the detailed description.
	 * Usage :
	 * @code
	 * <?php
	 * 	$example=myfunction(1,2,3);
	 * ?>
	 * @endcode
	 */
	 
	Note that the example code should be within the @code, 
	@endcode sub-block and that should come right below the
	detail description of the code.
	
	===== RULE 8 =====
	
	REFERENCING:
	
	If you want the reader of the code to also refer to some other
	function, class, file, or a URL, you can use the following:
	
	/**
	 * ...
	 * @see a_function()
	 * @see a_class
	 * @see a_filename.php
	 * @see a_class::its_member_variable
	 */
	 
	===== RULE 9 =====
	
	NOTES and TODO:
	
	/**
	 *
	 * @note This is a note for you, or someone else, to remember.
	 * @todo This is a TODO for the code below.
	 * @todo Another TODO item for the code.
	 */
	 
	EXAMPLE 1:
	
	DOCUMENTATION OF FILE common.lib.php :
	
	/**
	 * @package pragyan
	 * @file common.lib.php
	 * @brief Contains the most frequently used functions by CMS
	 * It has functions related to database connectivity, user
	 * information retrieval, and other string manipulating
	 * functions also.
	 * @todo The templates related functions should be moved to 
	 * the template.lib.php instead of here.
	 * @author Abhishek Shrivastava <i.abhi27[at]gmail.com>
	 * @copyright (c) 2010 Pragyan Team
	 * @license http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ GNU Public License

	 */ 
	
	EXAMPLE 2:
	
	DOCUMENTATION OF CLASS googlemaps in GoogleMaps.class.php :
	
	/**
	 * @class googlemaps 
	 * @brief Class to render Google maps in article module
	 * It uses the GoogleMaps API and Geocoding technique to
	 * convert the location name entered by the user into the
	 * precise location in the map.
	 * Usage:
	 * @code
	 * 	$html = googlemaps::render($location_name);
	 * @endcode
	 * The $html will contain the HTML code for the map.
	 * @todo Add the option for the user to specify the default 
	 * zoom
	 * @warning This code requires internet connection to work. 
	 * So make sure you are connected to internet before 
	 * modifying and testing.

	 */
	 
	EXAMPLE 3:
	
	DOCUMENTATION OF FUNCTION arraytostring($array)
	
	/**
	 * Convert an array to a string recursively
	 * @param $array Array to convert
	 * @return string containing the array information
	 */
	 
	NOTE : All the documentation blocks should appear BEFORE the 
	code for which documentation is done.

(4)++++++++ CMS WORKING OVERVIEW +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
______________________________________________________________________


	______________________________________________________________
	
	::::::::::::::::::::::: PAGES ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
	______________________________________________________________
	
	The Pragyan CMS works with the concept of pages. Each page on 
	the CMS, is called a page (!).
	All pages have the following properties : 
		page id, parent page id, page name, module name, 
		module component id.
	
	______________________________________________________________
	
	::::::::::::::::::::::: PAGE PATH ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
	______________________________________________________________
	
	If pages are arranged in the form of a tree, with each page's 
	parent node  being the page having page id same as that page's
	parent page id, we get the complete website tree. 
	
	Using this website tree the page paths are formed. To find the
	page of a particular page, keep going up until the root page 
	is encountered. 
	
	The root page is the page with both page id and the parent 
	page id equal to 0.
	
	For example, in the website tree:

		root
		+---classes
		|	+---fir
		|	|	+---a
		|	|	+---b
		|	|	+---c
		|	+---sec
		|	|	+---d
		|	|	+---e
		|	|	+---f
		|	+---thi
		|		+---g
		|		+---h
		|		+---i
		+---rules
		|	+---gen
		|	+---spe
		+---tests
		|	+---fir
		|	+---sec
		|	+---forum
		+---departments
			+---comsc
			+---ece
			+---civil

	The page path of the page named a will be: /classes/fir/a
	The page path of the second page named b will be: 
	/classes/thi/b
	______________________________________________________________
	
	::::::::::::::::::::::: MODULE :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
	______________________________________________________________
	
	All pages have a property called module name. This module name
	specifies the type of the page. Each module must come complete
	with its own set of actions that provide an interface for the 
	user to interact with the module. Each action may use several
	subactions privately to work effectively.

	For example, Article is a module that supports viewing 
	(action "View") and editing (action "Edit"); and Form is a 
	module that supports viewing (to register), editing, and 
	viewing and editing of registrants.

	Users or groups can be granted permissions for each action 
	(but not each subaction) separately, this implies that a 
	module must divide the different tasks that can be performed
	on it in such a way that tasks that might require different 
	levels of authorization are implemented as different actions. 
	For example, an article must be viewable by mostly all 
	visitors to a web site, but it must be editable only by a 
	select few. Hence, View and Edit are different actions.

	Modules may be plugged into and out of the Pragyan CMS as 
	required.
	______________________________________________________________
	
	::::::::::::::::::::::: PAGE ID ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
	______________________________________________________________
	
	All pages have a unique page id. 
	The root of Pragyan CMS starts from a /home directory. This 
	can however be changed through the .htaccess file.
	
	The part of the path specified after /home is called the page 
	path.
	
	For example, in 
	http://pragyan.org/myinstallfolder/home/events/forum, 
	the page path is /events/forum
	
	Using the page path, the page id is computed.

______________________________________________________________________

(5)++++++++ PRETTY URLS ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
______________________________________________________________________
	
	Everything after /home in the $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] variable
	is called the page path. This page is found using this page 
	path.
	
	Example : 
	In the request 
	http://pragyan.org/myinstallfolder/home/events/forum,
	
		the CMS install folder is : myinstallfolder
		the CMS root is : home
		the page path is : /events/forum
		
	In case any action is passed to the page, it is passed by 
	appending a + symbol followed by the action. 
	
	Example :
	To perform the action edit on a page /events, the REQUEST_URI 
	would be : http://pragyan.org/myinstallfolder/home/events+edit
	
	For passing any GET variables, the format is the same as 
	normal PHP file, except that instead of the first ? symbol, an
	& symbol is to be used. 
	
	Example :
	To pass the get variable id with value 2, the REQUEST_URI 
	would be : http://pragyan.org/myinstallfolder/home/events&id=2
	
	An example with multiple GET variables and an action :
	http://pragyan.org/home/events/forum+edit&threadid=56&postid=1
	Here,
		Page path is : /events/forum
		Action is : edit
		GET variables are : threadid = 56 and postid = 1

______________________________________________________________________

(6)++++++++ PERMISSIONS ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
______________________________________________________________________

	______________________________________________________________
	
	::::::::::::::::::::::: OVERVIEW :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
	______________________________________________________________
  
The permissions module handles the responsibility of resolving the 
actions that any given user can perform on any given page. The module
is used during every page access to determine if the user has the 
rights to perform the requested operation on that page.

A permission may be a page-level permission, or a module-level 
permission. A page-level permission is one that does not depend on the
module of the given page, that is, the permission is available 
regardless of the page module. A module-level permission is specific
to a module. Different modules may have their own set of permissions
defined. For example, grant and settings are page-level permissions,
while view is necessarily a module-level permission, and there may
even be modules that do not support viewing at all. 

All the functions required to calculate, and manipulate permissions
are packaged inside permission.lib.php

	______________________________________________________________
	
	::::::::::::::::::::::: STORING PERMISSIONS ::::::::::::::::::
	______________________________________________________________
	
The permissionlist Table:
The permissionlist table maps the actions available for each module 
to a permission id (perm_id).
The actions are displayed in the action bar on each page in an order
determined by the permission rank (perm_rank).
The userpageperm Table:
The userpageperm table stores all the set permissions, for each user
on each page. The permission may be yes (Y) or no (N).

Only the permissions that have been set explicitly are
stored. Effective permissions are calculated based on rules described 
in the next section.

	______________________________________________________________
	
	::::::::::::::::::::::: CALCULATING PERMISSIONS ::::::::::::::
	______________________________________________________________

To determine whether a given group has permissions to perform a 
certain operation on a given page, the following procedure is used:
+ Move up the page path, one level at a time, and check for any set
permissions for the group for the correct module and action.
+ On encountering a no, the result is no. Quit the procedure.
+ If the root is reached without encountering any set permissions, the
result is again no.
+ If the root was reached after encountering at least one yes, the 
result is yes.

To determine whether a given user can perform a given operation on a 
given page, the following algorithm is used:
+ Find all the groups the user belongs to.
+ Calculate the permissions of each of the groups, in increasing order
of priority. If any group has an effective permission of Y, the user 
is also given the permission.
+ If all groups have permission unset or N, calculate the permission 
for the user himself using exactly the same procedure as that for a 
group, and the result is the permission thus calculated.  

	______________________________________________________________
	
	::::::::::::::::::::::: GRANTING PERMISSIONS :::::::::::::::::
	______________________________________________________________

* add() is defined as :
* 	start from top, if you find a no on the way, answer is no,
*		if you find no nos and at least one yes, answer is yes
*		if you find nothing, (all unsets) answer is no
*
* All groups have a certain priority assigned to them.
* Possible permissions are  : Y, N, unset (i.e. no value in the table)
* To find the permission for a particular action on a particular page:
* 	Find all groups that he belongs to.
*  	Take all the groups priority wise and start from the lowest 
	priority group and do this for each group:
* 		In the page path, starting from the root node going
		towards the leaf node, do add and get the result
* 		Group all results of same priority, and make it yes,
		if even a single yes is available (OR)
* 		Now, we ll have an array of yeses and nos arranged by
		priority.
*    +-----------+---+---+---+---+
* 		| Priority: | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
*    +-----------+---+---+---+---+
* 		| Perm    : | N | N | Y | N |
*    ------------+---+---+---+---+
* 		i.e Do an OR to get result (regardless of priority).
*
* -- Condition: To give a user the perm_grant permission, he has to
		belong to a group. --
*
* While giving permission: (grant)
* 	For one module, for one page:
* 	Find all groups that he belongs to.
* 	If he gets perm_grant individually : find the highest 
	priority group that he belongs to . save it in A
* 	If he get perm_grant from group(s) :
* 		Find groups which give him perm_grant on that page
* 		Find the highest priority among those. save it in B
* 		Allow him to give or take permission only from those 
		groups with priority <= max(A,B)
* 		Allow him to give or take permission from all 
		individual users.
______________________________________________________________________

(7)++++++++ MODULE +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
______________________________________________________________________

	For creating a module file, refer module.lib.php file.
	The below section deals with how to package the module.lib.php
	with what extra files so that it is accepted by Pragyan CMS
	and installed via the Module Management feature.

	______________________________________________________________
	
	:::::::::::: CREATING MODULE INSTALLATION PACKAGE ::::::::::::
	______________________________________________________________
	
	
	- Make three files moduleQueries.sql, moduleNotice.txt,
	  moduleTables.txt in the same folder as that of the 
	  module file(.lib.php file)
	- moduleQueries.sql should contain only valid sql commands
		* Note that everything in the file will be executed
		  while installing the module, so if you want to add 
		  something else make sure that you do so with "--" 
		  to comment it out
		* The sql queries are expected to
			- create the tables necessary for the module
			- insert module permissions in into 
			  permissionlist table
				* skiping value for `perm_id` column
				* Since permissionlist table name can 
				  vary, keep it as 
				  'pragyanV3_permissionlist' in your
				  query, cms will take care of prefix
			- and NOTHING ELSE
	- moduleNotice.txt can be any notice to the admin who is 
	  installing your module to his PRAGYAN CMS
	- moduleTables.txt should contain module table names separated
	  by ';' and should contain nothing else
	- if you want to include any file with your module, then it 
	  has to be within a folder with the same name as that of the
	  module and has to be kept with the module file.

	Example Folder Structure which has to be zipped:
	module
		- module.lib.php
		- moduleNotice.txt
		- moduleQueries.sql
		- moduleTables.txt
		- module
			* file_1
			* file_2
______________________________________________________________________

(8)++++++++ TEMPLATES ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
______________________________________________________________________

All the templates are stored in the cms/templates folder. Every
template folder must have a index.php file which contains the template
source code. The associated css and image files can be put in css and
images directories inside the cms/templates/template-name folder.
	______________________________________________________________
	
	::::::::::::::::::::::: CREATING TEMPLATES :::::::::::::::::::
	______________________________________________________________
	
	Prepend all css paths by <?php echo $TEMPLATEBROWSERPATH; ?>
	The following are the list of labels which are recognised by
	Pragyan CMS and replaced during template HTML rendering :
	$TITLE : Title of the page
	$MENUBAR : Vertical side Menubar of the page
	$ACTIONBARMODULE : Module-defined actions
	$ACTIONBARPAGE : Actions which are NOT module-specific
	$BREADCRUMB : Shows the current page path in a link-able way
	$CONTENT : Main HTML content generated by the CMS or Module
	$DEBUGINFO : Debugging information (only used by Developers)
	$ERRORSTRING : Errors encountered by the CMS

(8)++++++++ WIDGETS ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
______________________________________________________________________

	Widgets are module-like applications that can be coded for
	Pragyan CMS and displayed in the page along with the template.
	For example, think of Wordpress widgets on the left hand side
	that includes a calender, HTML box, images, maps, archive,
	popular posts, etc. Basically widgets are able to communicate
	with the core of Pragyan CMS but they are different than
	modules as in they don't occupy a full page and they don't
	have specific permissions and actions. But widgets are good
	for providing small-sized useful tools in the UI to improve
	the user's experience. Normally they do it by hardcoding in
	the template, but no more !
	______________________________________________________________

        ::::::::::::::::::::::: Working ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
        ______________________________________________________________

	Pragyan CMS provides a platform to develop widget in such a 
	way that it can be understood and called by Pragyan CMS. Here
	is a list of things Widgets are supposed to do :
	* They must have a class by the name of the widget in a single
	file called widget.class.php placed inside the widget folder.
	* The class must extend the abstract class widgetFramework.
	* The class must implement the abstract function in the super
	class widgetFramework, which are __construct, initWidget and 
	getHTML.
	
	Now, we'll see how Praygan CMS understands and renders them.
	Assuming the user has enabled some widgets and rearranged them
	to appear in some particular locations in the current page.
	Here's brief algorithm about how that page is processed :

	1) Get the list of all widgets enabled for that page along
	with their location ID and order number.

	Note : Every location in the template must have a unique
	location ID that must be decided by the template creator.

	Multiple widgets can be placed in the same location in which
	case the order number will be used to arrange them.

	2) For every widget in the list, get the widget folder name
	and widget class name for that widget and look for path 
	/cms/widgets/<widget-folder-name>/widget.class.php and include
	that file. 

	3) After the file is successfully included try to create an
	instance of the class <widget-class-name> which must be
	defined in the included widget.class.php file.

	4) After the instance is created, check whether the instance
	extends the widgetFramework class and has its methods.

	5) While creating the instance the constructor was activated
	with the parameters which include the pageId, widgetId and 
	widgetInstanceId.

	6) The constructor stores all the variables and then calls the
	constructor of the pre-defined super class widgetFramework
	with another added parameter which is the $configs array which
	contains the list of all the configurations associated with
	that widget in proper format along with type and defaults.

	7) The constructor of the widgetFramework will store all the
	variables and the configuration and calls the loadWidget
	method which loads the current values for the widget settings
	and saved data from last session for the particular widgetId
	and widgetInstanceId.

	8) If no settings could be retrieved it could only mean that
	either the widget has no configurations at all, or it has not
	been set i.e. widget is processed the first time. In this case
	the configurations are saved in the database with default
	values and again the loadWidget method is called.

	9) Once the loadWidget function is called, the $settings and 
	$data arrays gets populated with the settings and data from 
	the previous session and the widget can use it to configure
	itself.

	10) The above was happening in the constructor call itself.
	Now, the Pragyan CMS calls the initWidget method which must
	be user-defined in the widget class. There is no such 
	restriction as to what needs to put in that function but its
	just a flexibility given to the developers to write some
	initialization code (if they want to).

	11) Finally, the getHTML method is called by Pragyan CMS and
	the getHTML method should have the actual widget code to 
	generate the HTML output that will be displayed on the page.
	In this method, all the configuration current values from
	$settings must be used to configure the output and also the
	saved data from $data could be used.

	12) The output generated from getHTML is stored in the 
	$WIDGETS array at the index which is equal to the widget's 
	location ID. For multiple widgets in the same location, the
	output is appended. 

	13) So the entire point was to properly populate the specific
	indexes of $WIDGETS array for the current page. Its done and
	now comes the template factor. The template should explicitly
	echo the contents of the $WIDGETS array at specific positions
	corresponding to the unique location ID of that position.

	e.g. <?php echo $WIDGETS[4]; ?> will echo the content of all
	widgets placed at location ID 4, ordered by their order number
	in this exact location.

	So this is how the widgets are rendered. Also go through the
	file widget.lib.php for more description about the algorithm.

        ::::::::::::::::::::::: DEVELOPING :::::::::::::::::::::::::::
        ______________________________________________________________

		
	For developing the widget, aside from the rules mentioned in
	the previous section certain other rules should be followed.

	Recalling, all the widget files should be placed inside a
	folder which must be placed inside the cms/widgets folder.
	Inside the widget folder, atleast a single file called 
	widget.class.php should be there which must have define a
	class extending the widgetFramework class and implementing the
	abstract functions getHTML and initWidget along with the
	constructor.

	The constructor must call the parent class constructor by
	passing all the existing parameters along with an extra 
	configurations array. 

	For the exact prototype of the array and function details
	with documentations, view the widget.class.php file of the
	sample widget Server Date and Time, inside the folder with the
	name server_date_time.

	Once this folder with the required files having the required
	function definitions are ready, simple put the folder inside
	the cms/widgets folder and then add an entry into the
	_widgetsinfo table. As of now, you'll have to add an entry in
	there manually as there is no interface for it. A Widget
	Installation feature similar to Template Installation will 
	come soon.

	Thats it, your widget should now appear in the +widgets
	action on any page. You can configure the global-configuration
	of widgets from +admin&subaction=widgets action, the link is
	there in Admin page in Widget Management.

	For more details about the algorithm, view the widget.lib.php
	file which has the algo described.
